# BayesianNetworks

Programming Language used: Python 3.9.13

Omega Compatibility: No

For compilation and testing: Use PyCharm

How the Code is structured:

1) The code is structured into two main components: the Bayesian Network class and the main function.
2) The Bayesian Network class encapsulates the probabilistic model and methods for calculating conditional probabilities.
3) Within the Bayesian Network class, there are attributes representing the probabilities of different events and methods for calculating conditional probabilities.
4) The main function parses command-line arguments to determine the values of variables representing events in the Bayesian network.
5) It then creates an instance of the Bayesian Network class and uses it to calculate the conditional probability based on the provided values and conditions.
6) Finally, it prints out the calculated probability.

How to run the code:

On the terminal, type "python bnet.py Bf At Mt" and it should output the conditional probability to the screen. or you can type "python bnet.py Bf At Mt" on the command line in PyCharm and press build.
